# adb-ops

Claude Code plugin for Android Debug Bridge (ADB) operations — onboard a phone, save folder mappings, import media with one command, capture screenshots, and manage bloatware with a persistent, auditable log.

## What it does

`adb-ops` turns a connected Android device into a first-class workspace for Claude Code. You onboard the phone once (model, Android version, rooted status, folder mappings), and from then on you can say "import my camera photos" or "remove the carrier bloat" and Claude knows exactly what you mean.

## Workspace

All user state lives at `~/.claude/adb-ops/` (outside the plugin so it survives updates):

- `profile.yaml` — device info
- `mappings.yaml` — phone path ↔ local path mappings with labels and use cases
- `bloatware-log.jsonl` — append-only log of every package operation

## Skills

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `onboard` | First-run interview: device info + folder mappings |
| `device-status` | Snapshot of connected devices, battery, storage |
| `take-screenshot` | Capture and pull a screenshot |
| `import-media` | Pull media from the phone using saved mappings (incremental or full) |
| `remove-bloatware` | Disable or uninstall packages safely, logged to the workspace |
| `bloatware-log` | Browse the bloatware operation history |
| `pull-folder` | Ad-hoc `adb pull` for paths not in mappings |
| `push-folder` | Local-to-device transfer (mapping-driven or ad-hoc) |

## Requirements

- `adb` installed on the host (Linux: `sudo apt install adb`, macOS: `brew install android-platform-tools`).
- Phone with USB debugging enabled and authorised for this computer.

## Installation

```bash
claude plugins marketplace add danielrosehill/Claude-Code-Plugins
claude plugins install adb-ops@danielrosehill
```

## First run

Ask Claude to run the `onboard` skill. Have the phone connected and unlocked.
